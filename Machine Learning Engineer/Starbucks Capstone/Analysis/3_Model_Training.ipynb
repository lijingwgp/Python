    "### 1.1 Data labeling\n",
    "Strategy:\n",
    "- To answer the first key questions above, we should rephrase it as \"which type of offers (informational, discount or bogo offers), a given customer is most likely to complete\". This way, we would be able to construct a multi-class learning objective and train a model of our choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labeling logic:\n",
    "0. A customer with a \"info_or_promo\" 0 indicates the following scenarios:\n",
    "    - This customer has not received any offers at all, hence labeled as unsuccessful.\n",
    "    - This customer has received informational offers (at least one), but failed to view them. Hence labeled as unsuccessful.\n",
    "    - This customer has received promotion offers (at least one), but failed to complete them. Hence labeled as unsuccessful.\n",
    "1. A customer with a \"info_or_promo\" 1 indicates this customer has received and viewed at least one informational offers.\n",
    "2. A customer with a \"info_or_promo\" 2 indicates this customer has received and completed at least one discount offers.\n",
    "3. A customer with a \"info_or_promo\" 3 indicates this customer has received and completed at least one bogo offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional notes:\n",
    "- For an informational offer, success means viewing the offer; for a promotion offer, success means complete the offer.\n",
    "- Some customers may receive the same offer multiple times and they may or may not complete all of them. For this case, we only want to count when the customer completes such offer at least once. This is a modeling decision because when customer complete the same offer multiple times, it introduce duplicates to the dataset. And when the customer does not complete all of the same offers they receive, it introduce noise to the dataset."

    "- The entire first section of this component is designated to define a labeling strategy in which the resulted targets can be utilized by a machine learning model. We decided that the model learning objective would be predictiing multi-class labels. \n",
    "    - If a customer receives an informational offer and completed (viewed) it, then this instance would be labeled as class 1.\n",
    "    - If a customer receives a discount offer and completed it, then this instance would be labeled as class 2.\n",
    "    - If a customer receives a bogo offer and completed it, then this instance would be labeled as class 3.\n",
    "    - All else instances are labeled as class 0.\n",
    "- During the final feature praparation part, we intentionally left out features come from the portfolio dataset. Our goal is to train a model that only relies on customers' characteristics as well as their purchasing history.   \n",
    "- Please note that results (rfm_score, clusters) from the previous component remains in the final training set. This is because these results are derived from the characteristics of the customers and the analysis can be replicated in the future if we were given a set of unseen customers records to be learned in modeling training.

This trend indicates that the model became more and more stable as more training samples are introduced. In addition, there is no sign of overfitting, and it is very likely that the training error and test error came across at around 0.63."

    "### 2. Model training conclusion\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "- A logistic regression model, with class_weight option set as balanced, was first trained to establish baseline model performance, in terms of f1-weighted score. We observe that its test score was 0.54 which is almost equivalent to a dummy classifier.\n",
    "- Next, a lightGBM classifier was trained, and we observe that there is no performance gain even if lightGBM is considered as a potentially better learner in many cases. This result prompt us to further include more information from the portfolio dataset, namely the channels feature. \n",
    "- Please note that the portfolio dataset contains information that describes each offer's nature, and our modeling objective is to predict which type of offers (information, bogo, or discount) a given customer would most certainly complete. So if we were adding to much information from the portfolio dataset, we would have high risk of information leakage. The maximum level of tollerance towards adding in new features, would be only allowing the channels feature to be added to the training set.\n",
    "- As a result, a trained lightGBM classifier improves its test f1 weighted score to 0.63. But we also observe that there is no potential value presides in other features that describe customer characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "- We conclude that a trained lightGBM classifier model eventually will achieve 0.63 as the final testing f1 weighted score. This score has been improved from 0.55 when the channels column was not included. Since we only added the channels column as an extra feature and no sign of improvements are observed during parameter tuning, we conclude that the testing score improvements is mainly caused by the channels column, and there is only a fixed amount of information that a model can learn off of. This conclusion can be proven by observing from model's curve.\n",
    "- This scoring result is rather poor and it implies that the model should not be used in production until either more meaningful features are added or data labeling logics are refined."

    "Original plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the first key question (which type of offers to send) is answered, we can move onto the second key question, \"which particular offer would help business achieve highest revenue and lowest cost?\". A common approach to solve this problem would be starting from a train model and analyze its error rates such as recall, and precision. By adjusting the probability threshold (only applicable in a binary problem), we would be able to observe how recall and precisions behaves accordingly. Then by applying the cost assumptions to various recall/precision, we would be able to obtain a cost function that allows us to determine at what probability threshold and recall/precision level, the cost of modeling errors could be minimized. \n",

    "However, since our modeling objective is mul-class prediction by design, the concept of adjusting the probability threshold will not be applicable in our case. Thus, I purposely choose to do a cost simulation instead of a cost analysis. The machanism that drives the simulation is that by adjusting predicted probabilities of each class, we would obtain various level of simulated modeling error rates for which we could then apply to the cost assumptions. As a result, different cost will be shown in addition to their associated error rates and other modeling performance metrics. We would then be able to pick a cost that's acceptable. In the subsequent model improvement works, we can aim to achieve that observed modeling performance, knowing that the cost would be minized as a result of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "New question to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the decision made above, I will rephrase the second question which is stated in the begining of this analysis. Thus, instead of answering \"which particular offer would help business achieve highest revenue and lowest cost?\", I will use the following cost simulation to answer \"given the current state of the model, what improvements can be made in regards to modeling performance for each class label, to achieve a minimized cost after applying the cost assumptions?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional note:\n",
    "- It's because predicted class probabilities are the main driver for various level of prevision and recall, we choose it as the sole input of the simulator function.\n",
    "- The current model performance is rather poor. This is another reason I decided to do simulations because it represents hypothetical cases to show a minimized cost that can be potentially achieved if model performance is improved to a certain level."

    "\n",
    "Questions to answer:\n",
    "1. How does the customer groups labeled as ideal and valuable react to each type of offer?\n",
    "2. Should the marketing team send offer to a particular rewards program customer?\n",
    "3. Given the current state of the model, what improvements can be made in regards to modeling performance for each class label, to achieve a minimized cost after applying the cost assumptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings:\n",
    "- Discount offers are the most popular ones among customers who are labeled as \"ideal\" and \"valuable\". In addition, the same groups of customers most likely come from cluster 1.\n",
    "- To answer the second question, our original intent was to train/tune a machine learning model and let it predict which offer types a given customer would most likely to complete. Then the business could plan ahead using these prediction results. However, even after taking the risk of information leakage by adding the \"channels\" column, our final model still produces inferior results. \n",
    "- Based on this condition and the learning objective (multi-class) of our model, I switched from conducting a cost analysis to a cost simulation, in order to answer question 3. As a result, we found the area that future improvements is most needed is class 3 results. Specifically, we would like to achieve a 0.77 for class 3 recall in order to minimize the cost, given all other class predictions does not change."
